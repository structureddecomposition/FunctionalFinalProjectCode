# CIS-11 Final Project
Create an LC-3 program that displays the frequency of characters of user full name.
Input: User is prompt to input his or her full name.
Output: Numerical value the represent the frequency of a character in the user fullname.
The program must fulfill the following criteria:
1.	Contain appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output. (20 points)
2.	Display counted values in console. (20 points)
3.	Use appropriate labels and comments. (20 points)
4.	Contain appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations. (40 points)
5.	Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls. (20 points)
6.	Use branching for control: conditional and iterative. (30 points)
7.	Manage overflow and storage allocation. (20 points)
8.	Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack. (20 points)
9.	Include save-restore operations. (30 points)
10.	Include pointer (20 points)
11.	Implement ASCII conversion operations (30 points)
12.	Use appropriate system call directives. (10 point)
13.	Testing (20 points): Test the program using the team names.
